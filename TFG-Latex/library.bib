abstract = {The interest in nonparametric statistical analysis has grown recently in the field of computational intelligence. In many experimental studies, the lack of the required properties for a proper application of parametric procedures–independence, normality, and homoscedasticity–yields to nonparametric ones the task of performing a rigorous comparison among algorithms. In this paper, we will discuss the basics and give a survey of a complete set of nonparametric procedures developed to perform both pairwise and multiple comparisons, for multi-problem analysis. The test problems of the CEC’2005 special session on real parameter optimization will help to illustrate the use of the tests throughout this tutorial, analyzing the results of a set of well-known evolutionary and swarm intelligence algorithms. This tutorial is concluded with a compilation of considerations and recommendations, which will guide practitioners when using these tests to contrast their experimental results.}

abstract = {Bio-inspired optimization (including Evolutionary Computation and Swarm Intelligence) is a growing research topic with many competitive bio-inspired algorithms being proposed every year. In such an active area, preparing a successful proposal of a new bio-inspired algorithm is not an easy task. Given the maturity of this research field, proposing a new optimization technique with innovative elements is no longer enough. Apart from the novelty, results reported by the authors should be proven to achieve a significant advance over previous outcomes from the state of the art. Unfortunately, not all new proposals deal with this requirement properly. Some of them fail to select appropriate benchmarks or reference algorithms to compare with. In other cases, the validation process carried out is not defined in a principled way (or is even not done at all). Consequently, the significance of the results presented in such studies cannot be guaranteed. In this work we review several recommendations in the literature and propose methodological guidelines to prepare a successful proposal, taking all these issues into account. We expect these guidelines to be useful not only for authors, but also for reviewers and editors along their assessment of new contributions to the field.}

abstract="The differential evolution (DE) is a stochastic, population-based, and relatively unknown evolutionary algorithm for global optimization that has recently been successfully applied to many optimization problems. This paper presents a new variation on the DE algorithm, called the cooperative co-evolutionary differential evolution (CCDE). CCDE adopts the cooperative co-evolutionary architecture, which was proposed by Potter and had been successfully applied to genetic algorithm, to improve significantly the performance of the DE. Such improvement is achieved by partitioning a high-dimensional search space by splitting the solution vectors of DE into smaller vectors, then using multiple cooperating subpopulations (or smaller vectors) to co-evolve subcomponents of a solution. Applying the new DE algorithm to on 11 benchmark functions, we show that CCDE has a marked improvement in performance over the traditional DE and cooperative co-evolutionary genetic algorithm (CCGA).",
